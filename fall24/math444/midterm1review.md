Here are some optional practice problems from the book that are similar to what might be on the midterm on Friday.  You can skip the ones with hyperbolic sine and cosines ($\sinh$ and $\cosh$) since we never talked about those functions. 

* Chapter 1: [Exercises 1.1 - 1.6, 1.8, 1.12][1e]
* Chapter 2: [Exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.6, 2.12, 2.17, 2.18][2e]
* Chapter 3: [Exercises 3.1, 3.7, 3.14, 3.18, 3.20, 3.40, 3.41, 3.45][3e]

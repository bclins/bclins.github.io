\subsection*{Fuel Economy Calculator}

For this project, you will write a program to calculate how many miles per gallon (MPG) a car got on its last tank of gas.  Your program should prompt the user to enter the number of miles the car drove, and how many gallons of gas they filled the tank with.  Then the program should calculate the fuel economy in miles per gallon for that tank of gas.  All of the prompts and output should be complete sentences with proper punctuation.  The final output of your program should look similar to this example output:

\begin{verbatim}
You got 25.6 miles per gallon on your last tank of gas.
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Of course the number in the output that you get will probably be different than 25.6 since it will depend on the numbers that the user inputs.

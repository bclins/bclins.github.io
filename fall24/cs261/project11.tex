\subsection*{Snowmen}

For this project you will create Python classes to draw snowmen using \verb|tkinter|.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item You'll probably want to create basic a few classes to draw shapes likes circles, triangles, lines, and rectangles.  To create these, you should use the following methods of a \verb|Canvas| object. Of course, you'll have to pick values for all of the argument variables. 

\begin{verbatim}
canvas.create_rectangle(left, top, right, bottom, fill=color)
canvas.create_oval(left, top, right, bottom, fill=color)
canvas.create_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill=color, width=10)
\end{verbatim}


\end{enumerate}

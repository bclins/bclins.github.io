\subsection*{Practice Final Exam - CS 261}
\textit{Here are questions similar to what will be on the final exam.  You won't be able to use any outside material during the final exam (no notes, computers, etc.) so see how much you can answer without looking things up. Be sure to study any Python rules and terminology that you don't know. }

\question Write a function \verb|near_and_far()| that accepts three ints \verb|a|, \verb|b|, and \verb|c| as arguments. Return \verb|True| if one of \verb|b| or \verb|c| is "close" to \verb|a| (differing from \verb|a| by at most 1), while the other is "far", differing from \verb|a| by 2 or more. Hint: you can use the \verb|abs()| function to find the absolute value of any number.

<h1 class="title">Math 121 - Midterm 2 Suggested Study Problems</h1>
</header>
<p>Here are problems that are similar to the ones you might see on the
exam. Be sure to also review old quiz and workshop questions too.</p>
<h3 id="experiments-vs.-observational-studies">Experiments
vs. Observational Studies</h3>
<p>Know the difference between explanatory variables, response
variables, and lurking variables. Also, make sure that you understand
why randomized controlled experiments let you establish cause and effect
but observational studies do not.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A NY Times article titled <em>Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to
Dementia</em> states the following:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who
participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to
1985, when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the
group had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer’s disease and 416
with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the
researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than
nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased
smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more
than two packs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why?</li>
<li>What are the explanatory and response variables?</li>
<li>Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia
later in life? Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>In a public health study on the effects of consumption of fruits and
vegetables on psychological well-being in young adults, participants
were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) diet as usual, (2) an
intervention involving text message reminders to increase their fruits
and vegetable consumption plus a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a
fruit and vegetable intervention in which participants were given two
additional daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables to consume on
top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to take a nightly
survey on their smartphones. Participants were student volunteers at the
University of Otago, New Zealand. At the end of the 14-day study, only
participants in the third group showed improvements to their
psychological well-being across the 14-days relative to the other
groups.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>What type of study is this?</li>
<li>Identify the explanatory and response variables.</li>
<li>Were the individuals in the study a random sample from the
population?<br />
</li>
<li>Were the individuals randomly assigned to different treatment
groups?<br />
</li>
<li>Does this study support the claim that giving young adults fresh
fruits and vegetables to eat can <em>cause</em> psychological
benefits?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="probability">Probability</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>If you flip a fair coin 10 times, what is the probability of
<ol type="a">
<li>getting all tails?</li>
<li>getting all heads?</li>
<li>getting at least one tails?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A Pew Research survey asked 2,373 randomly sampled registered voters
their political affiliation (Republican, Democrat, or Independent) and
whether or not they identify as swing voters. 35% of respondents
identified as Independent, 23% identified as swing voters, and 11%
identified as both.
<ol type="a">
<li>Are being Independent and being a swing voter disjoint,
i.e. mutually exclusive?</li>
<li>Are being Independent and being a swing voter independent events.
Hint: if they were independent, then you could use the multiplication
rule to calculate the probability that someone is both a swing voter and
a political Independent. Does the multiplication rule give the correct
answer?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Data collected at elementary schools in DeKalb County, GA suggest
that each year roughly 25% of students miss exactly one day of school,
15% miss 2 days, and 28% miss 3 or more days due to sickness.
<ol type="a">
<li>What is the probability that a student chosen at random doesn’t miss
any days of school due to sickness this year?</li>
<li>What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses no
more than one day?</li>
<li>What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses at
least one day?</li>
<li>If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what
is the probability that neither kid will miss any school? Note any
assumption you must make to answer this question.</li>
<li>If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what
is the probability that both kids will miss some school, i.e. at least
one day? Note any assumption you make.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="weighted-averages-and-expected-value">Weighted Averages and
Expected Value</h3>
<p>Expected value (also known as the theoretical average) is the
weighted average of the outcomes in a probability model. Make sure you
understand why it is called “expected” and how to calculate it. You
should know the Law of Large Numbers too.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Andy is always looking for ways to make money fast. Lately, he has
been trying to make money by gambling. Here is the game he is
considering playing: The game costs $2 to play. He draws a card from a
deck. If he gets a number card (2-10), he wins nothing. For any face
card ( jack, queen or king), he wins $3. For any ace, he wins $5, and he
wins an extra $20 if he draws the ace of clubs.
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a probability model for this game.</li>
<li>Draw a probability histogram for the game.</li>
<li>Find the expected value of the game.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="random-variables">Random Variables</h3>
<p>When we use a letter to represent the numerical outcome of a
probability model, that letter is called a random variable. You should
be comfortable with the way random variables are used in notation, like
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>5</mn><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(X &gt; 5)</annotation></semantics></math>
for example.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Suppose
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>X</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math>
is a

random variable. Find the following.
<ol type="a">
<li><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>540</mn><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(X &gt; 540)</annotation></semantics></math></li>

</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sampling-distributions">Sampling Distributions</h3>
<p>Make sure you know the shape, center, and spread for the sampling
distributions of the sample mean
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mover><mi>x</mi><mo accent="true">‾</mo></mover><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bar{x}</annotation></semantics></math>
and the sample proportion
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mover><mi>p</mi><mo accent="true">̂</mo></mover><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\hat{p}</annotation></semantics></math>.
Be sure you can describe how they change as the sample size gets
larger.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMSHA) suggests that 69.7% of 18-20 year olds consumed
alcoholic beverages in any given year. Suppose we consider a random
sample of fifty 18-20 year olds.
<ol type="a">
<li>Describe the sampling distribution for the proportion that have
consumed alcoholic beverages in the past year. What is the shape,
center, and spread of the distribution.</li>
<li>Estimate the probability that at least 80% of the individuals in the
sample have consumed alcohol in the past year.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>(<a
href="http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.5.1">Exercise
5.1</a>) For each of the following situations, state whether the
parameter of interest is a mean or a proportion. It may be helpful to
examine whether individual responses are numerical or categorical.
<ol type="a">
<li>In a survey, one hundred college students are asked how many hours
per week they spend on the Internet.</li>
<li>In a survey, one hundred college students are asked: “What

</ol></li>
<li>As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer
at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to
test the current rate of chips with severe defects. She finds that 27 of
the chips are defective.
<ol type="a">
<li>What population is under consideration in the data set?</li>

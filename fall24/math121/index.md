The schedule above is tentative, and may be subject to change. Changes will be announced in class, and you are responsible for knowing about any changes even if you miss the class when they are announced. 

### Attendance Policy

Attendance in this class is required. Repeated absences may result in a forced withdrawal from the course. You are responsible for any material you miss due to absence. Please let me know ahead of time if you know that you will not be able to attend class.

### Grading Policy

The term grade will be based on the following factors.

| Component &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Proportion  &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| :--- | :---: |
| Midterms  | 45% |
| Projects | 10% |
| Quizzes | 20% |
| Final Exam | 25% |  


### In-Class Problems
 
There is a saying that, "you learn math by doing math." This is very true! During most class periods you will be asked to solve problems in-class. Any problems you do not complete during class become homework problems. I do not collect these problems however. Instead, you may consult your notes & completed classwork during the weekly quizzes.

### Quizzes

Every Friday (except when there is a midterm exam) there will be a 10-15 minute quiz on recently covered material. Each quiz will have 3 or 4 problems and will cover material similar to the in-class and take-home problems. During quizzes you are allowed to use your notes and solutions to old class workshop problems. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped from the final average.


### Projects

There will be four homework projects at the end of the semester.  These projects will require you to analyze real world data, make graphs, carry out relevant statistical tests, and explain your conclusions.  The projects must by typed using a computer and you can e-mail them to me when they are due. If you wish, you may work with a partner on the project. If you do work with a partner then you can both submit one file together, just be sure that both of your names are clearly listed on the file that you submit.  Aside from work with your partner, all work should be your own. Each project will be graded holistically using the following rubric:

* **Grade: A.** Every part of the assignment is complete and your work is clear and correct.  
* **Grade: B.** Almost every part of the assignment is complete and your work is clear. There may be a few minor mistakes, but no major errors.  
* **Grade: C.** Most of the assignment is complete, but is either not clear or has significant mistakes.
* **Grade: D.** You turn in something, but it has major errors or omissions.  
 
The dates listed for the projects on the schedule above are when the projects *will be assigned*, not when they are due.  You will have at least 3 days from when a project is assigned until it will be due.  



### Exams

There will be three in-class midterm exams and a cumulative final. These exams will be announced in advance, and you will know exactly what concepts will be covered on each exam.  


### Office Hours

My office hours are shown on my [weekly schedule](https://bclins.github.io/index.html#weekly-schedule).  I am also available by appointment. If you can't stop by during my regular office hours, just ask me after class or by e-mail, and I'll be happy to make an appointment that works for both of us.  


### Special Accommodations

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester. Students also should contact Melissa Wood, Title IX/504 Coordinator (mwood@hsc.edu, 434-223-6061) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.

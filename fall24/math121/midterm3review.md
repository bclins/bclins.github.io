Here are problems that are similar to the ones you might see on the exam. Be sure to also review old homework and workshop questions too. The exam will have both multiple choice and short answer questions.  You can check the [answers to odd problems](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#appendix.A). 

### Confidence Intervals

* [Exercise 6.45](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.6.45)


### Hypothesis Testing 

Concepts to review: (i) The definition of a p-value (**memorize this**): *A p-value is the probability of getting a result at least as extreme as what happened, if the null hypothesisis true.* (ii) Make sure you understand when to reject a null hypothesis and what **statistically signficant** means.

* [Exercise 5.25](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.5.25)
* [Exercise 6.49](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.6.49)


### Differences in Two Proportions

Concepts to review: (i) Meaning of two-sample confidence intervals. (ii) Pooled proportions.

* [Exercise 6.18](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.6.18)
* [Exercise 6.21](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.6.21)
* [Exercise 6.25](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.6.25)

### Inference About Means

Concepts to review: (i) Degrees of freedom and how to use the t-distribution table.

* [Exercise 7.11](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.7.11)
* [Exercise 7.55](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.7.55)
* [Exercise 7.57](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.7.57)


### Matched Pairs Data

Know when to use one sample method for the differences in match pairs data instead of two-sample methods.

* [Exercise 7.17](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.7.17)
* [Exercise 7.21](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.7.21)

### Two Sample t-Distribution Methods

<!-- For next time: Both 7.23 & 7.25 are really matched pairs. And 7.23 is a much better matched pairs question than 7.21. Then 7.24 is a great 2-sample t-problem. -->

* [Exercise 7.23](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.7.24)
* [Exercise 7.25](http://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/books/OpenIntroStats4e.pdf#eoce.7.26)

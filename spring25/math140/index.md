The schedule above is tentative, and may be subject to change. Changes will be announced in class, and you are responsible for knowing about any changes even if you miss the class when they are announced. 

### Attendance Policy

Attendance in this class is required. Repeated absences may result in a forced withdrawal from the course. You are responsible for any material you miss due to absence. Please let me know ahead of time if you know that you will not be able to attend class.

### Grading Policy

The term grade will be based on the following factors.

| Component &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Proportion  &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| :--- | :---: |
| Midterms  | 45% |
| Quizzes | 30% |
| Final Exam | 25% |  


### In-Class Problems
  
There is a saying that, "you learn math by doing math." This is very true! During most class periods you will be asked to solve problems in-class. Any problems you do not complete during class become homework problems. I do not collect these problems however. Instead, you may consult your notes & completed classwork during the weekly quizzes.

### Homework Quizzes

There will be homework assigned every week.  These homework problems are due on Fridays, but I don't collect them.  Instead, there will be a homework quiz on Friday that covers the homework.  These quizzes will include problems that are similar to the ones on the homework.  You are allowed to use your notes and your homework solutions during the quizzes, but no calculators.  Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped from the final average. 

Please let me know in advance if you will be missing class. If you let me know ahead of time that you will
be missing class for a school sponsored event, then we can plan an alternative assignment. If you don’t let
me know until after the fact, then it will be too late. There are no make-up quizzes. That’s why I drop your
lowest quiz grade.

### Exams

There will be three in-class midterm exams and a cumulative final. These exams will be announced in advance, and you will know exactly what concepts will be covered on each exam.  Unlike the quizzes, you will not be able to use your notes or old homework assignments during the exams. 


### Office Hours

My office hours are shown on my [weekly schedule](https://bclins.github.io/index.html#weekly-schedule).  I am also available by appointment. If you can't stop by during my regular office hours, just ask me after class or by e-mail, and I'll be happy to make an appointment that works for both of us.  


### Special Accommodations

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester. Students also should contact Melissa Wood, Title IX/504 Coordinator (mwood@hsc.edu, 434-223-6061) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.

### Week 1 Notes

Day  | Section  | Topic
:-----:|:---:|:-----------------------
Mon, Jan 13  |  | Expressions and equations
Wed, Jan 15  | [1.1][1.1]  | Functions & graphs
Fri, Jan 17  | [1.2][1.2]  | Combining functions

### Mon, Jan 13

Today we introduced the course syllabus. Then we looked at how to solve the following equations algebraically. 

1. Solve $5-2x = -5$. (<https://youtu.be/7GShZYevLGU>)


1. Solve $\sqrt{3x + 1} = 4$. (<https://youtu.be/0gicD4STzpg>)

1. Solve $\dfrac{x}{x-1} = 3$. 

After we solved these equations, we also talked about the geometric interpretation of the solutions as places on a graph where a function has a certain y-value. 

4. Graph the line $y = 5 - 2x$ and check where it crosses the line $y = -5$. 

5. Graph the function $y = \sqrt{3x + 1}$.

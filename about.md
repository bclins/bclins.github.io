I've been a professor of mathematics at Hampden-Sydney College since 2008. I live in the Richmond area with my wife and two children.

### Running

I like to run, but not very fast. Two of my favorite places to run are High Bridge State Park and Pocohantas State Park. These are also great places for a bike ride.

### Card Games

I love classic card games like hearts, cribbage, and 500. I also like programming. A few years ago I started making card games that you can play online against the computer. The best one I've made so far is a version of [sixty-six](https://www.pagat.com/marriage/66.html), which happens to be one of the best two-player card games ever.

The schedule above is tentative, and may be subject to change. Changes will be announced in class, and you are responsible for knowing about any changes even if you miss the class when they are announced. 

### Attendance Policy

Attendance in this class is required. We will only meet 14 times all semester, so missing even one class is a big deal. Repeated absences may result in a forced withdrawal from the course. You are responsible for any material you miss due to absence. Please let me know ahead of time if you know that you will not be able to attend class.

### Grading Policy

The term grade will be based on the following factors.

| Component &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Proportion  &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| :--- | :---: |
| Midterm exam | 20% |
| Final exam   | 20% |
| Homework     | 60% |  


### Homework 
  
There is a saying that, "you learn math by doing math." This is very true! During most class periods you will be asked to solve problems in-class. Any problems you do not complete during class become homework problems. Homework problems are due at the beginning of the next class.  

### Exams

There will be a midterm and final exam.  After the exams, you will be able to submit test corrections to get 50% of points lost back.  

### Office Hours

My office hours are shown on my [weekly schedule](https://bclins.github.io/index.html#weekly-schedule).  I am also available by appointment. If you can't stop by during my regular office hours, just ask me after class or by e-mail, and I'll be happy to make an appointment that works for both of us.  


### Special Accommodations

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester. Students also should contact Melissa Wood, Title IX/504 Coordinator (mwood@hsc.edu, 434-223-6061) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.

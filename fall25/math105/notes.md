### Week 1 Notes

We started with a 30 minute assessment pre-test that is not for a grade.  After that we reviewed the rules for working with fractions. 

1. **Addition.** To add fractions, they need a common denominator (bottom).  Once you have a common denominator, just add the numerators (tops).  We did these examples:

    $$\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{2}{6} \text{ and }\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{2}{5}$$

2. **Multiplication.** I like to say that "fractions play nice with multiplication".  To multiply fractions, just multiply the tops and multiply the bottoms. 

    $$\dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \dfrac{2}{5}$$

3. **Division.** Division is just multiplication by the reciprocal.  You might have learned this as "keep-change-flip" or as "flip-and-multiply".  We did these examples:

    $$\dfrac{ ~\dfrac{1}{6}~}{~\dfrac{2}{5}~ } \text { and } \dfrac{ ~\dfrac{1}{6}~}{~5~ }.$$

### Week 2 Notes

Today we reviewed **order of operations** and how to solve algebraic equations that don't require factoring.  You might have learned the acronym 

* **PEMDAS** (**P**arenthesis, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication/**D**ivision, **A**ddition/**S**ubtraction) 

to remember order of operations. Another acronym is 

* **GEMS** (**G**rouping, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication/Division, Addition/**S**ubtraction).

Algebra notation can be helpful.  The notation for multiplication $2 \cdot 5$ or $(2)(5)$ and division $2/5$ or $\tfrac{2}{5}$ puts numbers close together. Numbers being added or subtracted are more spread out: $2 ~ \pm ~ 5$.  This is deliberate and it can help you remember that numbers being multiplied/divided are more tightly bound together and so those operations come before addition/subtraction.

1. Evaluate $\dfrac{1}{14} \left( \dfrac{1 + 2^2 \cdot 3}{7 + 2 \cdot 3} + 1 \right)^2$ (<https://youtu.be/jAVbApE7lJ8>)

After reviewing order of operations, we talked about: 

<div class="Theorem">
**The Most Important Rule of Algebra.** You can do whatever you want to an equation, as long as you do it to both sides!
</div>

More specifically, you can perform any algebraic operation to the expression on the left side of the equals sign as long as you also do the same operation to the right side expression.  **Caution:** Make sure you perform the operation to everything on both sides!  

2. Solve the following expression for $x$: $4 x + 2 - 6y = 0$

3. Solve $6x + 5 = 5x + 7$ (<https://youtu.be/r95Yh7dMVVc>)

We also talked about these two examples. 

4. Simplify $\dfrac{x - 5x^2}{5x}$

5. Explain why $2(a \cdot b) \ne 2a \cdot 2b$



<!-- 3. Solve $2(x+1) + 3(x-4) = 5$  -->

### Week 3 Notes

We started by talking about [Homework 1](HW/HW1.pdf). When you multiply & divide fractions, look for opportunities to cancel factors whenever possible:

1. $\dfrac{24x y^2}{35} \div \dfrac{54x^3 y^2}{63 xy}$. (<https://youtu.be/JIpvc0WbUBE?t=255>)

<div class="Theorem">
#### Factors versus Terms 

* A **factor** is an expression being multiplied/divided by other factors.  
* A **term** is an expression being added or subtracted from other terms.  
</div>

We reviewed these techniques:

* **Distributing** 
$$a (b + c) = ab + ac$$

* **Factoring out** common factors from terms.
$$ab + ac = a(b+c)$$

* **Canceling common factors** in fractions. 
$$\frac{5(x+1)}{x+1} = 5$$

* **Collecting like terms**. The coefficient keeps track of how many terms have been added together.
$$x + 2x + 3x = 6x$$

<!-- * If you are subtracting a term, that really means you are adding the negative version of the term. --> 


<!-- * **Quadratic factoring** is a fancy way to factor quadratic polynomial expressions (we'll focus on that later).-->

2. Expand $2x \left(4y + \dfrac{z}{2} + x^2\right)$.

3. Factor out all common factors from $30 x^2 y + 6 x y^2 + 12 x^2 y^3$.

4. Solve $\dfrac{x}{x-1} = 3$. 

5. Simplify $\dfrac{(x+3)(x+2)}{x+2}$. (<https://youtu.be/lBQmy1IMko8>)

- - -

### Week 4 Notes

We started by reviewing some of the common mistakes that came up in the last homework.  There were two that are worth mentioning.  

1. If you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, make sure you distribute that number to *every* term! 

2. When you take square roots, there are two answers, a positive one and a negative one. 

We reviewed these techniques (which are opposites of each other).

* **Factoring quadratic polynomials**. 

* **FOIL**-ing (**F**irst-**O**utside-**I**nside-**L**ast).

1. Expand $(3x+2)(5x-7)$. (<https://youtu.be/ZMLFfTX615w>)

2. Solve $s^2 - 2s - 35 = 0$.  (<https://youtu.be/2ZzuZvz33X0>)

We also talked about the **AC-method** and **factoring by grouping**.

3. Factor $4y^2 + 4y - 15$. (<https://youtu.be/u1SAo2GiX8A>)

4. How would you factor $4y^2 + 4y - 24$?  Is it easier or harder than the last problem?



- - - 

### Week 5 Notes

Today we talked about graphing equations, and we focused on two important special cases: lines and parabolas.  

<div class="Theorem">
**Equations for Line**

* **Slope-intercept form:** $y = mx + b$ 

* **Point-slope form:** $y - y_0 = m(x- x_0)$

where $m = \dfrac{\text{ rise }}{\text{ run }} = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is the **slope**, $b$ is the **y-intercept** and $(x_0, y_0)$ are the coordinates of any point on the line. 
</div>

1. Find an equation for the line that passes through $(-3,5)$ and $(2,1)$ in slope-intercept and point-slope form. (<https://youtu.be/lzqTD0JWwhY?t=174>)

2. Graph the line through $(4,-3)$ with a slope of $-2$. (<https://youtu.be/5mgH-_5UJ54>)

<!--
3. A father is three times as old as his son.  Five years ago, he was four times as old as his son.  How old are they now?
-->

<div class="Theorem">
**Quadratic Polynomials**

The graph of $y = ax^2 + bx +c$ is a parabola.  

* The **roots** are where the graph crosses the $x$-axis.

* If you can't factor, then you can find the roots using the **quadratic formula**
$$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$

* The **vertex** is where the parabola reaches its highest (or lowest) point. It is located at 
$$x = \dfrac{-b}{2a}.$$
</div>

3. What are the x-values of the roots and vertex for the parabola $y = x^2 - 5x + 6$?  Use those to help sketch a graph of the parabola. 

4. A local elementary school wants to make a rectangular flower garden along the side of the school building. One side of the garden will the be along the wall of the school, but the other three sides will be fenced off. If you have 60 feet of fencing material, what is the largest area possible for the flower garden?

We didn't have time for this last example, but there are a couple of problems on [homework 5](HW/HW5.pdf) that use this idea: 

5. Where does the parabola $y = x^2 + 4x + 6$ intersect the line $y= -3x - 4$? (<https://youtu.be/t6n-ShpFFjo>)

### Week 6 Notes

We started by going over questions about [Homework 5](HW/HW5.pdf) and some of the common mistakes on [Homework 4](HW/HW4.pdf).  In particular we talked about the fact that **a fraction is zero when its top is zero**.  A fraction is undefined if the bottom is zero, and we talked about why that is.. 

After that, we talked about **function notation** and **graphs**.  We did the following examples.  

1. Let $f(x) = \sqrt{25-x^2}$.  Find $f(0)$, $f(3)$, $f(4)$ and $f(0)$, then graph $y = f(x)$. <br> (see: <https://youtu.be/ucxtbUhjwYY>)

We also defined the **domain** and **range** of a function.  Then we looked at different ways to express functions.  For example, we had these two examples:

* The volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.

* The function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: $f(x) = \tfrac{9}{5}x + 32$. 

We also talked about **inverse functions**

2. Find the inverse of $V(r) = \tfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and explain what it does in words.

3. Find the inverse of $f(x) = 2x +1$. (see: <https://youtu.be/W84lObmOp8M>)


Finally we looked at using the graph of a function to answer questions like the following:

4. Use the graph of $f(x) = x^4 - 3x^2 + 2$ to find all values of $x$ where $f(x) > 0$. <br> (see: <https://youtu.be/0-SgHGSJpKM>)

### Week 8 Notes

Today we went over the midterm exam.  We also talked about the 

* [Major Concepts of Algebra](concepts.pdf).

### Week 9 Notes


This week we talked about using algebra to solve inequalities. 


<div class="Theorem">
**Function Crossing Rule**

For two functions defined using the usual operations ($+$,$-$,$\cdot$,$/$), the function which is greater can only change at an $x$-value where the graphs cross (are equal) or where one is undefined (a bad point).  

Therefore you can solve complicated inequalities with these two steps:

1. Mark the points of equality and any bad points on a number line.  
2. Check each resulting sub-interval to see if the inequality is true.  
</div>


<!--
<div style="padding-left: 10px; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
">
</div>
-->


We used this method to solve these examples. 

1. $-5c \le 15$ (Video solution: <https://youtu.be/D1cKk48kz-E>)

2. $x^2 \ge  7x - 12$ (Example video: <https://youtu.be/a10EuIFcphk>)

3. $\dfrac{6}{x-4} < 2$

### Week 10 Notes

We had the second midterm exam this week.

### Week 11 Notes

This week was about working with **exponents**.  


<div class="Theorem">
**Understanding Exponents**

1. Powers represent repeated multiplication. 
$$a^n = \underbrace{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot \cdots \cdot a}_{n \text{ copies}}$$

2. Negative powers represent reciprocals.
$$a^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{a^n}$$

3. Fraction powers represent roots. 
$$a^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{a}$$ 

</div>

From these basic ideas, you can work out all of the other [exponent rules](https://people.hsc.edu/faculty-staff/blins/classes/fall22/math105/AlgebraAxioms.pdf#page=3).

<table>
<tr><td><div class="Theorem" style="width:300px">
**Powers Count Repeated Factors**

Add powers of factors when you multiply.
$$a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$$ 

Subtract powers when you divide.
$$\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$$
</div></td><td><div class="Theorem" style="width:300px">
**Powers Distribute to Factors**

$$(a \cdot b)^n = a^n \cdot b^n \text{ and } \left( \dfrac{a}{b} \right)^n = \dfrac{a^n}{b^n}$$

Powers **do not** distribute to terms.
$$(a + b)^n \ne a^n + b^n$$
</div>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><div class="Theorem">
**Power of a Power**

$$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$$
</div></td><td><div class="Theorem">
**Zero Power**
$$a^0 = 1$$
</div></td></tr>
</table>


We simplified these examples in class:

1. $9^{-1/2}$ (<https://youtu.be/tn53EdOr6Rw>)

2. $(64)^{2/3}$ (<https://youtu.be/S34NM0Po0eA>)

3. $\left( \dfrac{a^3 b^4}{a^2 b} \right)^3$ (<https://youtu.be/AR1uqNbjM5s?t=332>)

4. $\sqrt{20x^6}$ (<https://youtu.be/kCP-ptqeNMQ>)

5. $\dfrac{8 a^6 b^{-4}}{24 a^{-8} b^9}$ (<https://youtu.be/7gTfmXhFOVo>)

### Week 12 Notes

Today we introduced **logarithms**.  We started by talking about **logarithmic scales**, which are number lines where the numbers are spaced by multiplication instead of addition.

<figcaption>A base-10 logarithmic scale</figcaption>
</center>

Logarithmic scales help understand the logarithm function.  

<!--
We started by talking about base-10 logarithms which tell you the order of magnitude of a number.  

<center>
<table class="bordered">
<tr><th>$x$</th><td>0.01</td><td>0.1</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>100</td><td>1000</td><td>10,000</td></tr>
<tr><th>$\log(x)$</th><td>$-2$</td><td>$-1$</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

Here is the definition of the logarithm for any base.
-->

<div class="Theorem">
**What are Logarithms?**

The **logarithm function** $\log_b(x)$ can be understood two ways:

1. $\log_b(x)$ equals the **number of steps** $x$ is away from 1 on a (base-b) log-scale.

2. $\log_b(x)$ equals the **power of b** needed to get $x$.  

</div>

1. Find $\log_2 16$. ([video](https://youtu.be/Z5myJ8dg_rM))

1. Find $\log_3 81$. ([video](https://youtu.be/Z5myJ8dg_rM?t=134))

1. Find $\log_{100} 1$. ([video](https://youtu.be/Z5myJ8dg_rM?t=353))

1. Find $\log_2 \left( \frac{1}{64} \right)$.  ([video](https://youtu.be/z9sJ3uusO98))

1. Find $\log_{10} (\sqrt{10}).$

Logarithms are useful because they convert difficult multiplication/division problems into easier addition/subtraction problems.  They also convert exponential patterns into linear patterns.  

<div class="Theorem">
**Properties of Logarithms**

1. Logarithms convert multiplication to addition $\log(xy) = \log(x) + \log(y)$. 
1. Logarithms convert division to subtraction $\log(x/y) = \log(x) - \log(y)$. 
1. Logarithms let you pull down powers $\log(x^p) = p \log(x)$. 
</div>

The most important base for exponential and logarithmic functions in calculus is the number $e \approx 2.71828$.  This is the **natural base** for the logarithm and exponential function for reasons that we'll see later when we talk about derivatives.  We write $\ln(x)$ to denote the base-e logarithm.  

6. What are $\ln(e^x)$ and $e^{\ln x}$?  

One of the most important applications of logarithms is that they let you solve equations with variables in the exponent. 

7. Solve $e^x = 2$.  

8. Solve $3^x = 2^{x+1}$ ([video](https://youtu.be/tJuTsq2TMm4))

### Week 13 Notes

We started by going over some problems from [homework 10](HW/HW10.pdf).  Then we talked about these examples. 

1. Where do the lines $y = 5x + 3$ and $y = -4x + 2$ intersect? 

2. What are the solutions of the system of equations $y = x + 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 25$? (<https://youtu.be/swFohliPgmQ>)

3. Solve $10^{2t - 3} = 7$. (<https://youtu.be/R443Db-wJ5o>)

After that, we spent the last 20 minutes of class on this [practice final exam](PracticeFinalExam.pdf).

### Week 1 Notes

We started with a 30 minute assessment pre-test that is not for a grade.  After that we reviewed the rules for working with fractions. 

1. **Addition.** To add fractions, they need a common denominator (bottom).  Once you have a common denominator, just add the numerators (tops).  We did these examples:

    $$\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{2}{6} \text{ and }\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{2}{5}$$

2. **Multiplication.** I like to say that "fractions play nice with multiplication".  To multiply fractions, just multiply the tops and multiply the bottoms. 

    $$\dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \dfrac{2}{5}$$

3. **Division.** Division is just multiplication by the reciprocal.  You might have learned this as "keep-change-flip" or as "flip-and-multiply".  We did these examples:

    $$\dfrac{ ~\dfrac{1}{6}~}{~\dfrac{2}{5}~ } \text { and } \dfrac{ ~\dfrac{1}{6}~}{~5~ }.$$

### Week 2 Notes

Today we reviewed **order of operations** and how to solve algebraic equations that don't require factoring.  You might have learned the acronym 

* **PEMDAS** (**P**arenthesis, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication/**D**ivision, **A**ddition/**S**ubtraction) 

to remember order of operations. Another acronym is 

* **GEMS** (**G**rouping, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication/Division, Addition/**S**ubtraction).

Algebra notation can be helpful.  The notation for multiplication $2 \cdot 5$ or $(2)(5)$ and division $2/5$ or $\tfrac{2}{5}$ puts numbers close together. Numbers being added or subtracted are more spread out: $2 ~ \pm ~ 5$.  This is deliberate and it can help you remember that numbers being multiplied/divided are more tightly bound together and so those operations come before addition/subtraction.

1. Evaluate $\dfrac{1}{14} \left( \dfrac{1 + 2^2 \cdot 3}{7 + 2 \cdot 3} + 1 \right)^2$ (<https://youtu.be/jAVbApE7lJ8>)

After reviewing order of operations, we talked about: 

<div class="Theorem">
**The Most Important Rule of Algebra.** You can do whatever you want to an equation, as long as you do it to both sides!
</div>

More specifically, you can perform any algebraic operation to the expression on the left side of the equals sign as long as you also do the same operation to the right side expression.  **Caution:** Make sure you perform the operation to everything on both sides!  

2. Solve the following expression for $x$: $4 x + 2 - 6y = 0$

3. Solve $6x + 5 = 5x + 7$ (<https://youtu.be/r95Yh7dMVVc>)

We also talked about these two examples. 

4. Simplify $\dfrac{x - 5x^2}{5x}$

5. Explain why $2(a \cdot b) \ne 2a \cdot 2b$



<!-- 3. Solve $2(x+1) + 3(x-4) = 5$  -->

### Week 3 Notes

We started by talking about [Homework 1](HW/HW1.pdf). When you multiply & divide fractions, look for opportunities to cancel factors whenever possible:

1. $\dfrac{24x y^2}{35} \div \dfrac{54x^3 y^2}{63 xy}$. (<https://youtu.be/JIpvc0WbUBE?t=255>)

<div class="Theorem">
#### Factors versus Terms 

* A **factor** is an expression being multiplied/divided by other factors.  
* A **term** is an expression being added or subtracted from other terms.  
</div>

We reviewed these techniques:

* **Distributing** 
$$a (b + c) = ab + ac$$

* **Factoring out** common factors from terms.
$$ab + ac = a(b+c)$$

* **Canceling common factors** in fractions. 
$$\frac{5(x+1)}{x+1} = 5$$

* **Collecting like terms**. The coefficient keeps track of how many terms have been added together.
$$x + 2x + 3x = 6x$$

<!-- * If you are subtracting a term, that really means you are adding the negative version of the term. --> 


<!-- * **Quadratic factoring** is a fancy way to factor quadratic polynomial expressions (we'll focus on that later).-->

2. Expand $2x \left(4y + \dfrac{z}{2} + x^2\right)$.

3. Factor out all common factors from $30 x^2 y + 6 x y^2 + 12 x^2 y^3$.

4. Solve $\dfrac{x}{x-1} = 3$. 

5. Simplify $\dfrac{(x+3)(x+2)}{x+2}$. (<https://youtu.be/lBQmy1IMko8>)

### Week 4 Notes

We started by reviewing some of the common mistakes that came up in the last homework.  There were two that are worth mentioning.  

1. If you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, make sure you distribute that number to *every* term! 

2. When you take square roots, there are two answers, a positive one and a negative one. 

We reviewed these techniques (which are opposites of each other).

* **Factoring quadratic polynomials**. 

* **FOIL**-ing (**F**irst-**O**utside-**I**nside-**L**ast).

1. Expand $(3x+2)(5x-7)$. (<https://youtu.be/ZMLFfTX615w>)

2. Solve $s^2 - 2s - 35 = 0$.  (<https://youtu.be/2ZzuZvz33X0>)

We also talked about the **AC-method** and **factoring by grouping**.

3. Factor $4y^2 + 4y - 15$. (<https://youtu.be/u1SAo2GiX8A>)

4. How would you factor $4y^2 + 4y - 24$?  Is it easier or harder than the last problem?

### Week 5 Notes

Today we talked about graphing equations, and we focused on two important special cases: lines and parabolas.  

<div class="Theorem">
**Equations for Line**

* **Slope-intercept form:** $y = mx + b$ 

* **Point-slope form:** $y - y_0 = m(x- x_0)$

where $m = \dfrac{\text{ rise }}{\text{ run }} = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is the **slope**, $b$ is the **y-intercept** and $(x_0, y_0)$ are the coordinates of any point on the line. 
</div>

1. Find an equation for the line that passes through $(-3,5)$ and $(2,1)$ in slope-intercept and point-slope form. (<https://youtu.be/lzqTD0JWwhY?t=174>)

2. Graph the line through $(4,-3)$ with a slope of $-2$. (<https://youtu.be/5mgH-_5UJ54>)


3. A father is three times as old as his son.  Five years ago, he was four times as old as his son.  How old are they now?

<div class="Theorem">
**Quadratic Polynomials**

The graph of $y = ax^2 + bx +c$ is a parabola.  

* The **roots** are where the graph crosses the $x$-axis.

* If you can't factor, then you can find the roots using the **quadratic formula**
$$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$

* The **vertex** is where the parabola reaches its highest (or lowest) point. It is located at 
$$x = \dfrac{-b}{2a}.$$
</div>

4. A local elementary school wants to make a rectangular flower garden along the side of the school
building. One side of the garden will the be along the wall of the school, but the other three sides will
be fenced off. If you have 60 feet of fencing material, what is the largest area possible for the flower
garden?

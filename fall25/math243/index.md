The schedule above is tentative, and may be subject to change. Changes will be announced in class, and you are responsible for knowing about any changes even if you miss the class when they are announced. 

### Attendance Policy

Attendance in this class is required. Repeated absences may result in a forced withdrawal from the course. You are responsible for any material you miss due to absence. Please let me know ahead of time if you know that you will not be able to attend class.

### Grading Policy

The term grade will be based on the following factors.

<!--
| Component &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Proportion  &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| :--- | :---: |
| Midterms  | 45% |
| Projects | 10% |
| Quizzes | 20% |
| Final Exam | 25% |  
-->

<table class="bordered">
<tr><td>Midterms</td><td>Quizzes</td><td>Projects</td><td>Final Exam</td></tr>
<tr><td>45%</td><td>20%</td><td>10%</td><td>25%</td></tr>
</table>

I use the following grading scale for quizzes and tests. 

<!--
| Letter Grade | Percentage |
| :---: | :---: | 
| A | 93 - 100 |
| A- | 90 - 92 |
| B+ | 87 - 89 |
| B | 83 - 86 | 
| B- | 80 - 82 | 
| C+ | 77 - 79 | 
| C | 73 - 76 | 
| C- | 70 - 72 | 
| D+ | 67 - 69 |
| D | 60 - 66 | 
| F | 0 - 59 |
-->

<table class="bordered">
<tr><td>A</td><td>A-</td><td>B+</td><td>B</td><td>B-</td><td>C+</td><td>C</td><td>C-</td><td>D+</td><td>D</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>≥ 93</td><td>90-92</td><td>87-89</td><td>83-86</td><td>80-82</td><td>77-79</td><td>73-76</td><td>70-72</td><td>67-69</td><td>60-66</td><td>≤ 59</td></tr>

### Homework
  
There is a saying that, "you learn math by doing math." This is very true! There will be homework problems assigned every week. These will be due on Fridays. I will not collect these problems however. Instead, you may consult your homework solutions & paper notes during the weekly quizzes.  

### Quizzes

Every Friday (except when there is a midterm exam) there will be a 10-15 minute quiz on recently covered material. Each quiz will have around 3 problems and will cover material similar to the homework problems. During quizzes you are allowed to use your paper notes and homework solutions. You cannot use a laptop or calculator or other device during the quizzes.  There are no make-up quizzes for absences. If you know that you will miss class on a Friday for an excused absence (athletic or other school sponsored event), then let me know in at least one day in advance so that we can arrange an alternative assignment. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped from the final average.

### Projects

There will be three or four projects during the semester. These projects will require you to model real world phenomena and write your conclusions. The projects must by typed using a computer and submitted as a PDF file. You can e-mail them to me when they are due or turn in a printed copy. If you wish, you may work with a partner on the project. If you do work with a partner, then you can both submit one file together, just be sure that both of your names are clearly listed on the file that you submit. Aside from work with your partner, all work should be your own. Each project will be graded holistically using the following rubric:

* **Grade: A.** Every part of the assignment is complete and your work is clear and correct.  
* **Grade: B.** Almost every part of the assignment is complete and your work is clear. There may be a few minor mistakes, but no major errors.  
* **Grade: C.** Most of the assignment is complete, but is either not clear or has significant mistakes.
* **Grade: D.** You turn in something, but it has major errors or omissions.  
 
Projects will be assigned at least one week before they are due.  



### Exams

There will be three in-class midterm exams and a cumulative final. These exams will be announced in advance, and you will know exactly what concepts will be covered on each exam.  Unlike quizzes, you won't be able to consult notes or old homework assignments during exams. 


### Office Hours

My office hours are shown on my [weekly schedule](https://bclins.github.io/index.html#weekly-schedule).  I am also available by appointment. If you can't stop by during my regular office hours, just ask me after class or by e-mail, and I'll be happy to make an appointment that works for both of us.  


### Special Accommodations

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester. Students also should contact Melissa Wood, Title IX/504 Coordinator (mwood@hsc.edu, 434-223-6061) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.

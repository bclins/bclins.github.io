### Attendance Policy

Regular attendance is crucial. There are only 20 classes during May Term.  You are responsible for any material you miss.  Any workshops you miss will be posted online, and will be due at the beginning of the next class.   

### Classroom Policy

Tobacco products (including chewing tobacco and e-cigarettes) are not allowed in class.


### Office Hours

My official office hours will be from 12:30 - 1:30pm on Mondays through Thursdays.  I am also available by appointment. If you can't stop by during my regular office hours, just ask me after class or by e-mail, and I'll be happy to make an appointment that works for both of us.  

### Grading Policy

The term grade will be based on the following factors.

| Component &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Proportion  &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| :--- | :---: |
| Workshops | 50% |
| Midterm 1 | 15% | 
| Midterm 2 | 15% | 
| Final Exam | 20% |  

I use the following grading scale for tests. 

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
| :---: | :---: | 
| A | 93 - 100 |
| A- | 90 - 92 |
| B+ | 87 - 89 |
| B | 83 - 86 | 
| B- | 80 - 82 | 
| C+ | 77 - 79 | 
| C | 73 - 76 | 
| C- | 70 - 72 | 
| D+ | 67 - 69 |
| D | 60 - 66 | 
| F | 0 - 59 |

### Exams

There will be two in-class midterm exams and a cumulative final. You can use a calculator during the exams, but not other outside materials.  It is okay if you use your cell phone as your calculator, as long as you only use it as a calculator during the exam.  

### Workshops

Most classes will include one or two workshops.  I'll usually collect them at the end of class.  Occasionally, if we aren't able to finish a workshop during class, I will assign it as homework.  Then it will be due at the beginning of the next class.  I will not accept late workshops.  Workshop problems will be graded on a 2 point scale.  A correct solution gets 2 points, while an incorrect solution is usually 1 point, unless you did not attempt the problem in which case it is worth zero points. 

### Special Accommodations

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester. Students also should contact Melissa Wood, Title IX/504 Coordinator (mwood@hsc.edu, 434-223-6061) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.

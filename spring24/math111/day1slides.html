<h1>Plurality Method</h1>
<p>The simplest way to pick a winner in an election with several
candidates is the <strong>plurality method</strong>: whichever candidate
gets the most votes wins.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The candidate with the most votes is called the <strong>plurality
candidate</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes, then they are a
<strong>majority candidate</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Majority ≠ Plurality.</strong> A majority candidate is
always a plurality candidate, but not vice versa.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="bad-things-about-plurality-method"
class="slide section level1">
<h1>Bad Things About Plurality Method</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Spoiler Effect</strong>: A <strong>spoiler
candidate</strong> is a candidate who will not win the election, but
will change the outcome if they decide to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spoiler candidates are closely related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategic Voting</strong>: When voters don’t vote for their
favorite candidate, but instead vote for a candidate they think has a
better chance of winning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Can you think of any recent examples of
elections with spoiler candidates and/or strategic voting?</p>

<div id="ranked-ballots" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Ranked Ballots</h1>
<p>One idea to reduce incentives for strategic voting is to let voters
rank all of the candidates using a <strong>ranked ballot</strong>:</p>

<p>In 2020, Alaska passed a law to use Instant Run-Off Voting to elect
the state’s one representative to the House of Representatives. The
method was used for the first time in 2022. The numbers below are not
the actual election results, but they are close, and they illustrate

<p>Here is an example from <em>Excursions in Modern Mathematics</em> by

International Olympic Committee. Suppose the votes were going to be:</p>

<div id="monotonicity-criteria" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Monotonicity Criteria</h1>
<p>In a fair voting method, when one or more voters change their vote to
help a candidate, it should not cause that candidate to lose.</p>
<p>Instant run-off voting fails the monotonicity criterion.</p>
<p>Note: In math, the word <strong>monotone</strong> means that when the
inputs increase, then the outputs also increase. For voting that means
that if a voter tries to help a candidate, it should actually help. Some
people argue that run-off voting is a very bad system because it is not
monotone.</p>

<h1>Borda Count Method</h1>
<p>In the Borda count method, candidates get points from each ranked

candidates running, then the first place candidate gets <span

who only get 1 point. Then the winner of the election is the candidate
with the most points.</p>

<p>In the table above, the points are shown in red. Each column
represents one possible ranking of the candidates, and the number of
voters who picked that ranking is shown at the top of the column.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Find the winner using Borda count.</p>
<!--
It is easy to figure out the total number of points each candidate gets from the preference matrix.  Just multiply the points in each entry by the number of voters in the column and then add up the rows to get the totals for each candidate. 

* Candidate A gets $10(3) + 20(2) + 30(1) + 5(1) = 105$ points. 

* Candidate B gets $10(2) + 20(3) + 30(2) + 5(3) = 155$ points.

* Candidate C gets $10(1)+20(1) + 3(30) + 5(2) = 130$ points.  

So candidate B wins with the most points.

<h1>Problems with Borda Count</h1>
<p>Jean Charles Borda proposed this method in 1770. It has the advantage
that spoiler candidates are much less likely to be a problem. But
Nicholas de Condorcet was very critical of the Borda count method.</p>
<h3 id="condorcets-criterion">Condorcet’s Criterion</h3>
<p>A <strong>Condorcet candidate</strong> is a candidate who would beat
all other candidates in a one-on-one run-off (i.e., a Condorcet
candidate would win a round robin tournament). Not every election has a
Condorcet candidate, but when one exists, Nicholas de Condorcet argued
that they should win the election. This is known as the
<strong>Condorcet criterion</strong> and it is one feature that a good
voting method should have.</p>

<h1>Borda Count Fails the Condorcet Criterion</h1>
<p>In fact, Borda count doesn’t even always elect the majority
candidate! Suppose 25 kids vote on the best ice cream flavor.</p>

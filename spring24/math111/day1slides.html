<h1>Plurality Method</h1>
<p>The simplest way to pick a winner in an election with several candidates is the <strong>plurality method</strong>: whichever candidate gets the most votes wins.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The candidate with the most votes is called the <strong>plurality candidate</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes, then they are a <strong>majority candidate</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Majority ≠ Plurality.</strong> A majority candidate is always a plurality candidate, but not vice versa.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="bad-things-about-plurality-method" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Bad Things About Plurality Method</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Spoiler Effect</strong>: A <strong>spoiler candidate</strong> is a candidate who will not win the election, but will change the outcome if they decide to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spoiler candidates are closely related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategic Voting</strong>: When voters don’t vote for their favorite candidate, but instead vote for a candidate they think has a better chance of winning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Can you think of any recent examples of elections with spoiler candidates and/or strategic voting?</p>

<h1>Ranked Ballots</h1>
<p>One idea to reduce incentives for strategic voting is to let voters rank all of the candidates using a <strong>ranked ballot</strong>:</p>

<div id="monotonicity-criteria" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Monotonicity Criteria</h1>
<p>In a fair voting method, when one or more voters change their vote to help a candidate, it should not cause that candidate to lose.</p>
<p>Instant run-off voting fails the monotonicity criterion.</p>
<p>Note: In math, the word <strong>monotone</strong> means that when the inputs increase, then the outputs also increase. For voting that means that if a voter tries to help a candidate, it should actually help. Some people argue that run-off voting is a very bad system because it is not monotone.</p>

<p>In the table above, the points are shown in red. Each column represents one possible ranking of the candidates, and the number of voters who picked that ranking is shown at the top of the column.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Find the winner using Borda count.</p>
<!--
It is easy to figure out the total number of points each candidate gets from the preference matrix.  Just multiply the points in each entry by the number of voters in the column and then add up the rows to get the totals for each candidate. 

* Candidate A gets $10(3) + 20(2) + 30(1) + 5(1) = 105$ points. 

* Candidate B gets $10(2) + 20(3) + 30(2) + 5(3) = 155$ points.

* Candidate C gets $10(1)+20(1) + 3(30) + 5(2) = 130$ points.  

So candidate B wins with the most points.

# Problems with Borda Count

Jean Charles Borda proposed this method in 1770.  It has the advantage that spoiler candidates are much less likely to be a problem. But Nicholas de Condorcet was very critical of the Borda count method.  

### Condorcet's Criterion

A **Condorcet candidate** is a candidate who would beat all other candidates in a one-on-one run-off (i.e., a Condorcet candidate would win a round robin tournament).  Not every election has a Condorcet candidate, but when one exists, Nicholas de Condorcet argued that they should win the election.  This is known as the **Condorcet criterion** and it is one feature that a good voting method should have.  


# Borda Count Fails the Condorcet Criterion

In fact, Borda count doesn't even always elect the majority candidate!  Suppose 25 kids vote on the best ice cream flavor.

### Week 1 Notes

Day  | Section  | Topic
:---:|:---:|:---------
Wed, Jan 17 | [1.1][1.1] | Review of functions
Thu, Jan 18 | [1.2][1.2] | Basic classes of functions 
Fri, Jan 19 | [1.2][1.2] | Basic classes of functions - con'd

#### Wed, Jan 17

Today we reviewed functions and function notation.  We talked about how $f(x)$ looks like $f$ multiplied by $x$, but it really means something completely different! We also talked about the following important functions (and their graphs) that you should have memorized:

1. **Linear functions** $f(x) = mx+b$.

2. **The square function** $f(x) = x^2$. 

3. **The positive square-root function** $f(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$. 

4. **The reciprocal function** $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}$.

5. **The 1-dimensional distance function** $f(x) = |x-a|$. 

We reviewed the definitions of **domain**, **range**, and **function composition**. We did the following examples in class. 

1. Let $f(x) = \dfrac{4}{x+2}$ and $g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}$. Find the domain of $f(g(x))$. (<https://youtu.be/PNzHrPebKOw>)

2. Two poles are connected by a wire that also connects to the ground between the poles. Find a formula for the length of the wire as a function of $x$ and determine the domain.

</center>

We didn't have time for this exercise, but it is also a good example of how to construct a function. 

3. A rectangular piece of cardboard is 10 inches by 8 inches.  If we cut squares of length $x$ out of the four corners, then we can fold the sides up to make a box.  Find a formula for the volume of the box as a function of $x$ and determine the domain. (<https://youtu.be/UvTYc5Wqu8w>)

<!--
4. The function $f(x) = \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$ has a graph that is a semicircle.  What is the domain & range of this function?
-->

<!--
#### Thu, Jan 18

Review linear functions and introduce piecewise function w/ the income tax example.

#### Fri, Jan 19

Review polynomial functions.


-->

#### Thu, Jan 18

Today we started with the wire between two poles example from yesterday.  Then we focused on linear functions. We reviewed **slope-intercept form** and did the following examples in class.

1. Find the formula to convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit.

2. Find a formula for the line through $(4,9)$ and $(6,1)$. (<https://youtu.be/LtpXvUCrgrM>)


As of 2023-24, the US Income Tax brackets for individuals earning up to \$95,375 are:

<center>

| Taxable Income | Rate |
| :---: | :---: |
| \$0 to \$11,000 | 10% |
| \$11,000 to \$44,725 | 12% |
| \$44,725 to \$99,375 | 22% |

</center>

3. Express income tax owed as a function of income for individuals earning up to \$44,725.  

Here is another good example that we didn't do in class:

4. Find the slope and intercepts of $3x+5y = 15$. (<https://youtu.be/SOwh-Wk7Cq0>)

#### Fri, Jan 19

Today we talked about **polynomial functions and equations**.  We briefly reviewed how to factor polynomials and we solved the following problems. 

1. Suppose $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 5x-6$.  Find the $x$-values where these two functions intersect. <!-- Also what does the function $f(x)-g(x)$ represent?-->

<!--2. Where does the line $y = 3x+2$ intersect the parabola $y = -4x^2 + 6$? (<https://youtu.be/JkMTthGWHUs>)-->

2. Solve $x + \dfrac{8}{x} = 6$. (<https://youtu.be/1fR_9ke5-n8?t=112>)

<!--4. Solve $\dfrac{x}{x+5} - \dfrac{5}{x-5} = \dfrac{14}{(x+5)(x-5)}$. (<https://youtu.be/1fR_9ke5-n8?t=519>)-->

3. Solve $\dfrac{x^2}{4} = \dfrac{2x}{x-6}$.  

In the last example, you should get to $x(x^2 - 6x - 8) = 0$.  Unfortunately there aren't integer factors of $-8$ that add up to $-6$.  So you need to use the **quadratic formula** 
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
to find all of the solutions.  You do not need to memorize the quadratic formula (it will be on the formula sheet on exams and you can look it up when you are doing your homework if needed).

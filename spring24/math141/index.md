### Course Description

Math 141 will cover functions, limits and continuity, derivatives & applications, and integration. By the end of this course, you should be able to use functions to model real-world situations, understand how limits are used to define derivatives and integrals, and apply derivatives and integrals to solve problems.

### Attendance Policy

In order to master a subject like calculus, regular attendance is crucial. However, if you have a fever or are not feeling well, then please do not come to class that day. As long as you let me know the reason for your absence, I will do my best to help you stay caught up and make up any material that you missed. The key is to communicate with me when you aren't able to attend class.  


### Classroom Policy

Tobacco products (including chewing tobacco and e-cigarettes) are not allowed in class.


### Office Hours

My office hours are shown on my [weekly schedule](https://bclins.github.io).  I am also available by appointment. If you can't stop by during my regular office hours, just ask me after class or by e-mail, and I'll be happy to make an appointment that works for both of us.  

### Grading Policy

The term grade will be based on the following factors.

| Component &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Proportion  &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| :--- | :---: |
| Quizzes | 25% |
| Midterm 1 | 15% | 
| Midterm 2 | 15% | 
| Midterm 3 | 15% | 
| Final Exam | 30% |  

I use the following grading scale for quizzes and tests. 

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
| :---: | :---: | 
| A | 93 - 100 |
| A- | 90 - 92 |
| B+ | 87 - 89 |
| B | 83 - 86 | 
| B- | 80 - 82 | 
| C+ | 77 - 79 | 
| C | 73 - 76 | 
| C- | 70 - 72 | 
| D+ | 67 - 69 |
| D | 60 - 66 | 
| F | 0 - 59 |

### Exams

There will be three in-class midterm exams and a cumulative final. The exams will be closed book and calculators will not be permitted.

### Homework Quizzes

Homework problems will be assigned every week. You are expected to complete all problems assigned. The assigned problems will not be collected however. Instead, every Friday there will be a homework quiz during which you must copy problems from your homework to the quiz. You may also have to solve an additional problem similar to the homework problems. You are allowed to use you homework and notes during the quizzes. No calculators are allowed during the quizzes, however you are welcome to use calculators or a computer when you do the homework. There are no make-up quizzes due to absence. If you know that you will miss a quiz, please let me know in advance so that we can work out an alternative assignment. Because there are no make-up quizzes, the lowest quiz grade will be dropped from your quiz average.


### Special Accommodations

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester. Students also should contact Melissa Wood, Title IX/504 Coordinator (mwood@hsc.edu, 434-223-6061) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.

### Announcements

* No announcements currently.
<!--Midterm 1 will be on Wednesday, Feb 21.  It will cover [these things](notes.html#mon-feb-19).-->

### Course Description

An introduction to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the algorithms that make these possible.  

### Tentative Schedule

The schedule below is tentative, and may be subject to change. Changes will be announced in class, and you are responsible for knowing about any changes even if you miss the class when they are announced.

### Attendance Policy

Attendance in this class is required. Repeated absences may result in a forced withdrawal from the course. You are responsible for any material you miss due to absence. Please let me know ahead of time if you know that you will not be able to attend class.

### Grading Policy

The term grade will be based on the following factors.

| Component &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Proportion  &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| :--- | :---: |
| Workshops | 40% | 
| Midterm 1 | 15% |
| Midterm 2 | 15% |
| Final Exam | 30% |  

### Workshops

Most weeks we will have one or more in-class workshops. We will use the Python programming language for many of these workshops, and will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for convenient access to Python. If you already have Python installed on your laptop, then you can use that instead of Google Colab. If you would like to install Python on your laptop, I recommend downloading Anaconda Individual Edition which is free.

We will do (or at least start) each workshops in class. Any in-class work that you do not finish will become homework that you will need to complete within one week of the class period when it was assigned.

### Exams

There will be two in-class midterm exams and a cumulative final. These exams will be announced in advance, and you will know exactly what concepts will be covered on each exam.  


### Office Hours

My office hours are shown on my [weekly schedule](https://github.bclins.io).  I am also available by appointment. If you can't stop by during my regular office hours, just ask me after class or by e-mail, and I'll be happy to make an appointment that works for both of us.  


### Special Accommodations

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course because of the impact of a disability are encouraged to meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester. Students also should contact Melissa Wood, Title IX/504 Coordinator (mwood@hsc.edu, 434-223-6061) to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.
